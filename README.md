# Damage calculator / planner for [Legends of Idleon](https://www.legendsofidleon.com/)

I wanted to make a small (failed) and simple (failed) website with modern vanilla javascript (succeeded) so this whole thing can be run locally with any webserver, for example: python 3 (`python3 -m http.server 8000`).


Currently supports the following classes:
- Beginner
- Warrior
- Archer
- Mage

It is not known if more will be supported.
